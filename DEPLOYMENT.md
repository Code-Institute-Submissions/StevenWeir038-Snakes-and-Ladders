# Deployment

Code Institute provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser. This is to improve the accessibiltiy of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found at [Snakes andLadders](https://snakes-and-ladders-sw.herokuapp.com/).
