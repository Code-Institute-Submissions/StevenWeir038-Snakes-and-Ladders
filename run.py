    GAME REQUIREMENTS
    ðŸŽ² Number of players: 2-4
    ðŸŽ² Required: 1 dice (six sided), pawns (1 for each player), playing board

    PRE-GAME
    ðŸŽ² Each player takes a different color pawn and throws the dice.

    GAME RULES
    ðŸŽ² The first player throws the dice and moves their pawn according to the
    number shown on the dice.
    ðŸŽ² If a player's pawn lands on an empty square there is no effect.
    ðŸŽ² If a player's pawn ends its move at the foot of a ladder, the pawn must
    move immediately to the square at the top of that ladder.
    ðŸŽ² If a player's pawn ends its move at the head of a snake, the pawn must
    immediately move to the square at the tail of that snake.
    ðŸŽ² Each time a player throws a 6, they are entitled to roll the dice and
    move again.

    VICTORY CONDITIONS
    ðŸŽ²  Be the first player to land on square 100.
