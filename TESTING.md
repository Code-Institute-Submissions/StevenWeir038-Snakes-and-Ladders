Using the [flowchart](docs/wireframes/flowchart.png "Game logic flowchart") as a guide, an incremental approach was used to build the application.

## IDE tools
The problems tab beside the terminal in gitpod provided warnings for code issues.  There are a few categories. Those of primary concern were highlighted red and needed to be resolved.
This was consulted every after writing several lines of code and was especially useful for resolving syntax errors and checking for unused variables.
